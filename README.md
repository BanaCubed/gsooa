# gsooA
gsooA is a math(s) revision helper that procedurally generates infinite questions of different types.

## Features
A key feature is the ability to choose what seed questions are generated with, allowing for many other features to function, and the ability to share a particularly challenging practice with friends!

The seeds feature is also used to allow for infinite Daily Challenges, and other competitive aspects, to be even theoretically possible.
